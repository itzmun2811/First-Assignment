         <p> One of Dr. Yunus's central goals is to a shift away from
             traditional profit-driven business models to social businesses.
              In his model, businesses operate to solve social problems while
               being financially self-sustaining, allowing communities to develop
                sustainably. 
            This approach is central to his vision for Bangladesh's future.
            He also emphasizes the importance of collaboration between government, businesses, 
            and individuals. He calls for systemic changes that prioritize social
             welfare, 
            education, and health, aiming to reduce inequality and promote justice.
